Project Whale Wallet: Foundational Design and Strategic Architecture Report
1. Executive Summary and Strategic Vision
The digital asset ecosystem faces a critical bifurcation in 2026. On one side, retail investors utilize high-friction, low-security browser extensions that prioritize connectivity over safety. On the other, institutional custodians offer fortress-like security but strip the asset owner of sovereignty, imposing counterparty risks and regulatory encumbrances that contradict the ethos of decentralized finance. High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs)—specifically those with liquid digital asset portfolios exceeding $10 million—find themselves in a perilous "Custody Paradox." They require the operational resilience, inheritance planning, and white-glove service of a private bank, yet they demand the non-custodial, censorship-resistant control of a hardware wallet.
Whale Wallet is designed to resolve this paradox. It is not merely a storage solution; it is a sovereign wealth preservation system designed for the "Prosumer Institution." The architectural foundation moves beyond the fragility of physical hardware dongles—which introduce supply chain vulnerabilities and physical seizure risks—toward a "Cold Wallet Without Hardware" model. This is achieved through a hybrid utilization of mobile Secure Enclaves, geographically distributed cloud Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and advanced Multi-Party Computation (MPC).
This report serves as the comprehensive design document for Whale Wallet. It synthesizes deep market analysis, cryptographic innovation (including Post-Quantum readiness), and AI-driven governance into a cohesive blueprint. The economic model eschews the predatory transactional friction of swap fees in favor of a membership-based, aligned-incentive structure analogous to the Amex Centurion model, adapted for the decentralized economy. The following ten sections detail the competitive gaps, the rigorous "Zero-Trust" security architecture, and the global infrastructure required to support a wallet that functions as a personal CFO, ensuring wealth resilience across generations.

2. Competitive Landscape Analysis
The current wallet landscape is fragmented, forcing HNWIs to cobble together disparate solutions that compromise either security or usability. To design Whale Wallet effectively, one must first deconstruct the existing paradigms: the hardware wallet oligopoly, the retail software wallet sector, and the institutional custody market.
Hardware Wallets: The Fragility of Physicality
Market leaders like Ledger and Trezor have established the standard for self-custody through "something you have" (the device) and "something you know" (the PIN). However, this model is showing its age. Snippets 1 and 2 highlight that while devices like the Ledger Stax and Trezor Model T offer improved screens and UX, they remain single points of failure. If a device is lost, the security reverts entirely to the seed phrase—a piece of paper or metal that is susceptible to theft, fire, or loss. Furthermore, the physical device is a vector for "wrench attacks" (physical coercion) and supply chain interdiction, where malware is injected before the device reaches the user. The "dumb signer" nature of hardware wallets means they blindly sign whatever hash is presented, provided the user presses the button, lacking any semantic understanding of the transaction's intent or safety.3
Retail Hot Wallets: Connectivity Over Security
Wallets like MetaMask and Phantom dominate the DeFi landscape due to their seamless connectivity to DApps. However, their security model is fundamentally fundamentally flawed for high-value assets. Keys are often stored in local browser storage or mobile keystores that, while encrypted, are accessible to malware if the host device is compromised.5 These wallets prioritize speed and low friction, often omitting the robust policy engines (e.g., transaction limits, time locks) that HNWIs require. While they support hardware wallet integration, this reintroduces the physical device issues mentioned above. The revenue model of these wallets, primarily driven by swap fees (often hidden spreads of 0.875%), misaligns incentives, encouraging excessive trading rather than asset preservation.5
Institutional Custody: The Barrier to Entry
Firms like Fireblocks and Copper offer the "Holy Grail" of security: MPC-based signing, policy engines, and no single point of failure. However, these are B2B solutions designed for funds and exchanges, not individuals. They require extensive KYC/AML, corporate entity formation, and often come with minimum AUM requirements that exclude even wealthy individuals. They are custodial or semi-custodial in nature, meaning the user does not have unilateral control over their assets.7
The Whale Wallet Opportunity
Whale Wallet targets the "sovereign individual" gap. It leverages the MPC and policy engine technology of Fireblocks but packages it in a non-custodial, user-centric mobile application. It replaces the hardware wallet with the user's existing high-security smartphone (leveraging the Secure Enclave) and replaces the seed phrase with a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol. This eliminates the physical attack surface while providing the governance controls of an institution.

3. USP Discovery: The Whale Value Proposition
The value proposition for Whale Wallet is derived from a deep understanding of the anxieties plaguing crypto-wealthy individuals. For a user with $50 million in Bitcoin, the cost of a transaction is negligible; the risk of a catastrophic loss is paramount. The research identifies three primary vectors of anxiety: physical coercion, inheritance failure, and operational error.
The $5 Wrench Attack and Physical Coercion
As detailed in snippets 9 and 10, the rise of "wrench attacks"—where attackers physically force victims to unlock their wallets—renders traditional encryption useless. A hardware wallet in a safe is secure against a remote hacker but vulnerable to a gun to the head. Whale Wallet's USP addresses this through "Plausible Deniability" and "Deep Duress" modes. Unlike simple panic buttons which might be detectable, Whale Wallet employs a decoy ecosystem. Entering a specific "Duress PIN" unlocks a fully functional wallet with a history of smaller, plausible transactions and a modest balance. This satisfies the attacker without revealing the main vault, effectively buying the user's safety with a fraction of their wealth.11
Sovereign Inheritance and the Bus Factor
The rigidity of blockchain immutability becomes a liability upon death. Snippets 13 and 14 highlight that millions of dollars are lost annually due to lost keys or the death of the primary key holder. Existing solutions require sharing seed phrases with lawyers or family members, introducing trust risks. Whale Wallet introduces a "Sovereign Inheritance" protocol. This system utilizes a "Dead Man's Switch" smart contract and dormant monitoring. If the user fails to "ping" the wallet (via biometric login) for a user-defined period (e.g., 6 months), the wallet automatically initiates a recovery protocol. This protocol effectively reconstructs the private key via Shamir's Secret Sharing and distributes shards to pre-designated heirs or guardians, ensuring wealth transfer without trusted intermediaries.15
The Personal CFO: Policy-Based Signing
HNWIs often act as their own family offices, but human error is inevitable. Institutional platforms like Fireblocks mitigate this with Policy Engines.7 Whale Wallet democratizes this technology. A user can set sovereign rules: "No transfers over $50,000 to a new address without a 24-hour delay and secondary biometric confirmation." This essentially places a "CFO" in the loop—in this case, a deterministic software rule engine that cannot be bribed, tricked, or bypassed, even by the user themselves in a moment of panic or error.8

4. 'Cold Wallet Without Hardware' Architectures
The core constraint of Whale Wallet is to provide the security of cold storage without the usability friction and supply chain risks of hardware devices. This necessitates a shift from the traditional "Single Key" model to a "Distributed Key" model using Multi-Party Computation (MPC).
The Evolution of MPC: From Theory to Mobile
Traditional wallets utilize a single private key (stored on a Ledger or Trezor). If this key is exposed, the funds are lost. MPC technology 22 splits the key into mathematical shares. In Whale Wallet's 2-of-3 Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), three key shares are generated:
1. Share A (User): Stored in the user's mobile device Secure Enclave.
2. Share B (Server): Stored in a cloud-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
3. Share C (Recovery): Stored offline or with a trusted guardian.
A transaction requires 2 of 3 shares to sign. The server (Share B) cannot sign without the user (Share A), ensuring the wallet remains non-custodial. However, the user (Share A) needs the server (Share B) to co-sign, allowing the server to enforce the "Personal CFO" policies defined in Section 3.
Mobile Secure Enclaves and TEEs
Research 24 indicates that modern smartphones possess hardware security modules (Secure Enclave in iOS, Titan M in Android) that rival dedicated hardware wallets. These chips are isolated from the main operating system, meaning that even if the phone's OS is compromised by malware, the key share within the enclave remains protected. Whale Wallet leverages this by generating Share A directly inside the enclave, ensuring it never touches the phone's RAM or storage in plaintext.
Cloud Trusted Execution Environments (Nitro/Confidential Space)
For Share B, Whale Wallet utilizes AWS Nitro Enclaves 26 or GCP Confidential Space.27 These are isolated compute environments that have no persistent storage, no interactive access, and are cryptographically attested. The Whale Wallet administration cannot access the keys inside these enclaves. The enclave is programmed to "release" its signature only when the user's Policy Engine rules are satisfied. This guarantees that the server-side checks are executed in a tamper-proof environment, preventing insider attacks.
The Air-Gap Fallback
For the ultra-paranoid user who refuses to trust a purely mobile/cloud setup, Whale Wallet supports an "Air-Gap" mode. Snippets 28 describe turning an old, factory-reset smartphone into a cold wallet. This device is kept permanently offline (Airplane Mode, Wi-Fi disabled). The main Whale Wallet app creates an unsigned transaction, converts it to a QR code, and the offline device scans it, signs it (using a key generated on that device), and displays the signed QR code back. This effectively replicates the security model of a dedicated hardware wallet like the NGRAVE ZERO 31 without the need for proprietary hardware.

5. Fee & Economic Model
The prevailing economic model in crypto wallets—percentage-based swap fees—is fundamentally misaligned with the interests of HNWIs. A 0.875% fee 5 on a $1 million rebalancing trade costs the user $8,750. This friction discourages portfolio management and incentivizes the user to leave the wallet ecosystem for exchanges, increasing risk.
Whale Wallet adopts a "Membership & Concierge" model, drawing inspiration from the Amex Centurion 34 and private banking fee structures.36 This model aligns the platform's revenue with the service provided (security, support, features) rather than the volume of trading, which is attractive to large holders.
The Membership Tiers
The model is stratified to filter users and subsidize the high costs of MPC infrastructure and human concierge support.
1. Orca (Base): Targeting the entry-level HNWI ($100k - $1M). A "Freemium" model that offers the core MPC security but limits the advanced policy engine and concierge.
2. Humpback (Pro): Targeting the mid-tier ($1M - $10M). A subscription model that unlocks the full Rule Engine, Inheritance Planning, and MEV protection.
3. Blue (Whale): Targeting the UHNWI ($10M+). A high-annual-fee membership that includes white-glove onboarding, 24/7 dedicated human support, and bespoke policy configuration.
Zero-Fee Trading
By charging a subscription, Whale Wallet can offer 0% swap fees (passing through only network costs). This is a massive competitive advantage. For a user trading $10M annually, the savings compared to MetaMask could exceed $80,000, easily justifying a $5,000 or $10,000 annual membership fee.

	________________
6. Global Infrastructure
To support a non-custodial wallet that relies on server-side co-signing (MPC), the infrastructure must guarantee high availability and low latency. If the Whale Wallet servers go down, users cannot sign transactions (since they need Share B). This necessitates a robust, globally distributed infrastructure.
Latency Optimization and Edge Computing
MPC protocols involve multiple rounds of communication between the signers. Latency is the enemy of usability. Whale Wallet employs a multi-region architecture where MPC nodes are deployed at the "Edge" (e.g., AWS Local Zones or Cloudflare Workers) close to the user. When a user in Tokyo initiates a transaction, they connect to a Tokyo-based MPC node, minimizing the round-trip time (RTT) for the cryptographic handshake.32
Disaster Recovery: The "Break Glass" Protocol
A common fear with MPC wallets is "vendor lock-in" or "vendor disappearance." If Whale Wallet ceases to exist, users lose access to Share B. To mitigate this, Whale Wallet implements a "Cold Bunker" disaster recovery plan. Encrypted backups of Share B are stored in offline, air-gapped bunkers (e.g., Swiss Alps 38). In the event of a catastrophic failure of the cloud infrastructure, a legal and technical protocol allows for the manual retrieval and decryption of these shares using a "Master Key" split among a decentralized governance council or legal trustees, allowing users to recover funds even if the company dissolves.

	________________
7. Security & Threat Model
The security model of Whale Wallet must withstand state-level actors, sophisticated criminal gangs, and the user's own mistakes. It adopts a "Defense in Depth" strategy, layering multiple security controls.
Transaction Simulation and "What You See Is What You Sign"
A major vulnerability in current wallets is blind signing—approving a hex string that turns out to be a wallet drainer. Whale Wallet integrates transaction simulation (using providers like Blowfish 20). Before any biometric check, the wallet simulates the transaction on a fork of the blockchain and presents a human-readable summary: "This transaction will transfer ALL your USDC to 0x123..." If the simulation detects a known malicious pattern or contract, it blocks the signing attempt at the UI level.
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Readiness
While blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum still rely on ECDSA (which is vulnerable to future quantum computers), the communication tunnel between the User and the Whale Wallet server can be secured today using PQC. Whale Wallet implements hybrid key exchange protocols using NIST-standardized algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber for the transport layer security (TLS). Furthermore, for the digital signatures themselves, the architecture is designed to support Dilithium and Falcon 40 as soon as the underlying blockchains support account abstraction or PQC upgrades, ensuring the wallet is future-proof.42
Supply Chain and App Integrity
To prevent attacks where a malicious version of the app is distributed (e.g., fake updates), the Mobile TEE performs an integrity check (hashing the app's code) and attests this to the Cloud Enclave. If the Cloud Enclave detects that the mobile app has been tampered with (root detection, debuggers attached, wrong hash), it refuses to participate in the MPC signing, effectively bricking the compromised app.39

	Biometric Hard-Binding: Shard A is cryptographically bound to the specific device's Secure Enclave. Restoring to a new phone requires "Social Recovery" or Shard C (Physical backup).24
	Malicious Contracts
	Signing a "drainer" contract.
	Transaction Simulation (Blowfish): Real-time simulation of the transaction result. The wallet displays "You are giving permission to spend ALL USDC," not hex code.20
	Cloud Insider
	Malicious admin at cloud provider/Whale Wallet.
	Nitro Enclave Isolation: Admin has no SSH access to the signing enclave. Code is immutable once deployed. Attestation proves to the user that the code hasn't changed.26
	________________
8. AI-Assisted Development Governance
Building high-assurance software requires more than just good developers; it requires adversarial testing. Whale Wallet employs an AI-driven development pipeline that utilizes "Dual Model Verification" 43 to ensure code safety before it is even compiled.
The Builder and The Breaker
The development process is bifurcated. One AI model (The Builder, e.g., trained on secure Solidity patterns) generates the code for smart contracts and wallet logic. A second, adversarial AI model (The Breaker, fine-tuned on exploit databases and red-teaming datasets) immediately attempts to find vulnerabilities, logic errors, or edge cases in that code.44
Automated Formal Verification
Beyond AI testing, the pipeline integrates automated formal verification tools. Critical components (like the MPC implementation) are mathematically proven correct using symbolic execution engines (like Manticore or Certora).45 The AI aids in generating the formal specifications required for these proofs, lowering the barrier to entry for formal methods.

	________________
9. Global Rule Engine (The "CFO in a Pocket")
The Global Rule Engine is the defining feature that elevates Whale Wallet above standard non-custodial wallets. It acts as a programmable firewall for the user's funds. Since the Cloud Enclave (holding Share B) must co-sign every transaction, it can enforce arbitrary logic before doing so. This allows the user to define a "Sovereign Policy" that governs their wealth.
Types of Policies
* Velocity Limits: "Allow up to $10,000 in transfers per day. Any amount above requires a 24-hour delay."
* Whitelisting: "Only allow transfers to these 5 known addresses. Any new address requires 2-factor approval."
* Time-Locks: "Block all transfers between 11 PM and 6 AM" (protecting against late-night bad decisions or physical attacks at home).
* Chain-Specific Rules: "Block all interactions with contracts not verified by Etherscan/Sourcify."
Zero-Trust Enforcement
Crucially, these rules are enforced inside the TEE. Even if the user's phone is stolen and the PIN is cracked, the server will reject a $1M transfer if it violates the Velocity Limit. The attacker cannot bypass this without compromising the cloud infrastructure as well.
Table 9.1: Policy & Rule Logic Examples


Rule Type
	Logic Example
	Use Case
	Velocity Limit
	IF sum(24h_outflow) > $50,000 THEN require_2nd_approval
	Prevents draining entire wallet in one session due to theft or coercion.7
	Whitelist Only
	IF destination NOT IN whitelist THEN block
	Corporate treasury or elderly protection to prevent romance scams/phishing.
	Time-Lock
	IF amount > $1M THEN delay_execution(24h) AND notify_concierge
	Gives user time to cancel if under duress or hacked. Mitigates the "immediate" nature of crypto theft.
	Gas Protection
	IF gas_price > 200 gwei THEN warn_user
	Prevents accidental overpayment during network congestion.
	Chain Specific
	IF chain == Solana AND interaction == 'unknown_program' THEN block
	Prevents interaction with malicious or unverified drainer contracts on high-speed chains.
	Duress Logic
	IF pin == DURESS_PIN THEN mode = DECOY AND alert = TRUE
	Activates the fake wallet view while silently notifying security contacts.
	________________
10. Whale UX: The "Private Banking" Interface
The user experience (UX) of Whale Wallet must bridge the gap between the technical complexity of MPC/blockchain and the luxury expectations of the target demographic. It should feel less like a "crypto tool" and more like a high-end fintech application (e.g., Coutts, JP Morgan Private Bank app).
Concierge Integration
For "Blue" tier members, the app includes a secure, end-to-end encrypted chat with a dedicated support team. This concierge can assist with technical tasks (e.g., "How do I bridge to Arbitrum?") or operational tasks (e.g., "Prepare a tax report for my accountant"). This brings the "Service" layer to the non-custodial world.18
Stealth and Privacy Features
The app supports "Stealth Mode," where the icon can be disguised as a calculator or weather app. Upon opening, the balance is hidden by default. The "Net Worth" dashboard aggregates data not just from the wallet, but from connected DeFi protocols, providing a holistic view of wealth rather than just a list of tokens.

11. Roadmap: Phased Rollout Strategy
Trust is the most valuable asset for a wallet targeting HNWIs. Therefore, the roadmap prioritizes slow, audited growth over rapid scaling. The rollout strategy employs a "Velvet Rope" approach, starting with family offices before opening to the broader public.
Phase 1: Architecture & R&D (Months 1-6)
Focus on building the core MPC-CMP libraries and the TEE integrations. The "Builder" and "Breaker" AI agents are trained. The first "Air-Gap" prototypes using old smartphones are tested.
Phase 2: The Audit Gauntlet (Months 7-12)
Before any real funds are secured, the codebase undergoes rigorous auditing. We engage top-tier firms (CertiK, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin) for manual and formal verification.48 A "Red Team" event invites hackers to breach the TEE infrastructure for a high bounty.
Phase 3: Alpha (Family Office) (Months 13-18)
Deployment to a closed group of 50 invited Family Offices. This phase focuses on high-touch concierge service and gathering feedback on the Policy Engine's usability. Features like Inheritance are tested in a sandbox environment.
Phase 4: Beta (Waitlist) (Months 19-24)
Opening to the top 1,000 on the waitlist. Introduction of the "Humpback" tier. Activation of the "Dead Man's Switch" on mainnet.

Conclusion
The design of Whale Wallet represents a fundamental maturation of the crypto-asset industry. By acknowledging that the primary threats to HNWIs are now physical and operational rather than purely cryptographic, we shift the paradigm from "Maximum Isolation" (hardware wallets) to "Maximum Resilience" (MPC + Policy). This architecture delivers on the promise of being your own bank, finally providing the vault door, the security guard, and the private banker in a single, non-custodial application.
